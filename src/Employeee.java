=> name of employee is final

=>use runtime polymorphism.

1. getInfo() method that takes the number of hours of work per day and salary of employee as parameter.

2. addSalary() method that will add 10$ to the salary of the employee if it is less than 200$.

3. additionalWork() method that will add 5$ to the salary of the employee if the hours spent on work is more than 6 hours.
